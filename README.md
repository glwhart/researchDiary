# Gus' Research Diary
Markdown "diary" of daily research efforts. Includes links to plots, results, outside posts/sites. 

Rules: 
* 10 mins is more than enough 
* Set goals in morning, report at end of day
* Ask Braxton to approve PR

## 3 Aug 23
Plan:
✔️ Bike + strength training
✔️ Talk/email Tyler/Rod about SDG and Chap 7  
* Read 30 mins, make notes  
* Work on 318 or 601 a bit 
* Anything on NNs or image AI
* No checking email before 4:30 (didn't do this well, but better than average)
* Stretch twice (only did it once)
✔️ Feedback on the Oliver paper. Argh.
✔️ Get housing for NSF trip


Reached out to Alejandro for some insight on the cluster enumeration problem.

Getting the feedback on the paper to Oliver was critical and time consuming. And the CE reading/thinking was important.

A pretty good day for productivity.

## 2 Aug 23
Plan:
* Talk/email Tyler about SDG and Chap 7  
✔️ Get MP and autoGR data and compare 
* Read 30 mins, make notes  
✔️ Work on 318 a bit (worked on this A LOT) 
* Anything on NNs or image AI
✔️ No checking email before 4:30
✔️ Stretch twice  
✔️ Anki review  

Daily notes:

The code for doing the double descent plots with Mark are in the directory [projects/double_descent](/Users/glh43/home/projects/double_descent). The data for the `urgr` and `urmp` energies are in [juliaCodes/ClusterEnumeration.jl/data/](/Users/glh43/home/juliaCodes/ClusterEnumeration.jl/data/). Code used to do today's work on comparing data from two different kpoint meshes and CEs for each dataset: `makeCE.jl`.

The difference between autoGR and MP energies is really small. The ~4 meV outlier seems to be due to a really uneven kpoint spacing for the MP grid, much less dense in one direction.

The fitting errors on both sets of data are also small.

Lost the whole afternoon to talking with potential students. Could have done more if that hadn't happened. Stayed off email most of the day, but didn't do it at the end of the day as planned...
